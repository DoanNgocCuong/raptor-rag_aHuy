Mother never sat down to eat with us; she would gently ask, \"Is it good?\" and then quietly continue tidying up. I grew up under her care, and with every step I take farther from home, my heart aches whenever I think of her. She doesn’t talk much, but her eyes always radiate love. The wrinkles on her face are like lines of time, telling stories of all the sacrifices and hardships she endured for our family.
